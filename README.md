# Angular Practice

This is an application I am building to practice wiring code to public and custom apis. It includes a jokes page, weather page, and a bulletin board. The bulletin board uses MySQL and NodeJS for the backend.


# Crashcourse - (local name of project)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
